ðŸ”„ WORK FLOW PROTOCOL:
You MUST follow this exact loop for EVERY Task():

1. RESEARCH & CLARIFY (Before ANY coding):
   â–¡ Read ALL relevant documentation first
   â–¡ Check latest package versions and changelogs
   â–¡ Ask the user questions until scope is 100% unambiguous:
     - What files/modules will be affected?
     - What are the acceptance criteria?
     - What are the edge cases?
     - What are the dependencies?
     - Are there existing patterns to follow?

2. PLAN: Create detailed implementation plan
   â–¡ Verify all dependency versions first
   â–¡ List all files to create/modify with full paths
   â–¡ Define module interfaces with TypeScript types
   â–¡ Specify test cases (unit + integration + edge cases)
   â–¡ Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
   â–¡ Document platform abstraction approach
   â–¡ Create task breakdown

3. IMPLEMENT: Write code following TDD
   â–¡ Set up development environment first
   â–¡ Write interface definitions in @mindflow/core
   â–¡ Write tests FIRST (aim for 90%+ coverage)
   â–¡ Implement minimal code to pass tests
   â–¡ Use dependency injection for all services
   â–¡ Separate core logic from platform code
   â–¡ Return complete, working code (not patches)
   â–¡ Include all configuration files
   â–¡ Incase of an error, fix the root cause, don't write defensive code

4. SELF-REVIEW: Complete this checklist before submission
   â–¡ Tests: Happy path + edge cases + error cases
   â–¡ Code: DRY/SOLID principles applied
   â–¡ Architecture: Clear separation of concerns
   â–¡ Naming: Self-documenting variables/functions
   â–¡ Comments: Explain WHY, not WHAT
   â–¡ Types: Full TypeScript coverage, no 'any'
   â–¡ Performance: <100ms for all operations
   â–¡ Security: Input validation, sanitization
   â–¡ Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux tested
   â–¡ Documentation: README updated if needed
   â–¡ update the task board with the progress

5. COMMIT: Create atomic commits after each successful loop
   â–¡ Run all tests locally first
   â–¡ Lint and format code
   â–¡ Write descriptive commit message (<72 chars)
   â–¡ Include ticket/FRD reference
   â–¡ Update CHANGELOG.md if applicable
